# Geo

**Geo** is a timeless [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) theme built for the modern web.

## Usage

Download `bootstrap.css` or `bootstrap.min.css` from `/swatch`. Replace the default Bootstrap stylesheet with one of these files.

To use the image backgrounds download the graphics inside `/img`. Graphics used on our test page can be found inside `/img/test`.

## Customization

Geo was built with [Bootswatch Swatchmaker](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/tree/gh-pages/2/swatchmaker).

To customize Geo edit `/swatch/variables.less` and `/swatch/bootswatch.less`. Refer to the Swatchmaker [README](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/tree/gh-pages/swatchmaker) for instructions to regenerate the Bootstrap stylesheet.
